# Call Management & Analytics

This call analytics portal provides a range of tools to analyse the call experience of your customers and monitor staff performance, 
both historically and in real-time.

The system collects information about all telephone calls, tracking where calls have routed to 
(including Call Routing Announcements/Auto Attendants) and storing DID, 
contact information and internal information such as users and agents.

## User Interface
This section provides an overview of the portals user interface, outlining what each area is for.

### Home & Navigation Bar
The 'Home' area is the first screen presented to users when they log into the system. It provides a jumping off point to access all the other features. 
The navigation bar on the left-hand side provides access to the different areas of the portal with the content areas being on the right.
On the 'Home' screen, the content area contains a subset of Favourite and Recent items.


### Favorites & Recent
To speed up access to commonly used items, the portal provides a list of favourite and recently used items. 

Recently used items are displayed in the order last used and are kept up to date automatically by the system.

Favourites can be added or removed by toggling the star (![Screenshot](/img/ic_grade_black_18dp.png)) icon next to any report, wallboard or filter.


### Clients
The 'Clients' area provides a list of all Wallboard applications that have been granted access to the system. This includes Wallboard for Amazon Fire TV applications which have been linked to user's accounts.
From this area it is possible to see status', link new clients or remove unused ones.

For more information, please refer to the [Clients](../../config/clients/) section.

 
### Users
The user section[^1] provides visibility of all users configured to use the user portal and all users configured on the communications platform.
It provides the ability to control what level of access (if any) users have to the portal, and which Workspaces they can see.

For more information, please refer to the [User Management](../../config/usermanagement/) section.

[^1]: The Users section will only be visible if administrator permissions are assigned to your account.

### Workspaces
Workspaces provide access to the main features of the product - Reports and Wallboards. They are an area where users can collaborate and share work, commonly at department or team levels.
Users can be given access to one or more Workspaces with various permissions levels. 

For more information, please refer to the [Workspaces](../../workspaces/) section.

#### Wallboards
Wallboards are designed to make key performance information available to a large number of users. They provide real-time updates about calls, including active calls, so that action can be taken to maintain service levels.
Wallboards are customizable with images/videos to promote corporate brands and can also be configured with alarms to ensure potential issues are brought to a supervisor's attention.

For more information, please refer to the [Wallboards](../../realtime/) section.

#### Reports
Reports provide access to all historical call information stored within the system. They can be used to lookup specific calls, track system usage, user performance or to identify trends. Reports are fully customizable, can be rendered as grids or charts and can be exported to Excel.

For more information, please refer to the [Reports](../../reports/) section.

#### Filters
Filters are used throughout the portal to ensure that the information being displayed relates to the required calls, queues, users etc. Filters created and stored in the workspace are available for all workspace users when running reports or configuring wallboards.

For more information, please refer to the [Filters](../../workspaces/filters/) section.
